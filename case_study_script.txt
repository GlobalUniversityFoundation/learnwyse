CASE STUDY VIDEO SCRIPT - DEVPUR WATER CRISIS
================================================================================


SCENE 1. EXT. DUSTY ROAD, DEVPUR - DAWN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A middle-aged villager pedals his creaking bicycle along a dusty road flanked by parched fields. His face bears quiet determination as he glides past grazing cattle and the rising morning mist. He coasts into the village and leans the bicycle against the mud-brick wall of his modest home.

NARRATOR (V.O.)
"Devpur is a tranquil village in the Suryanagar constituency"


SCENE 2. EXT. VILLAGE WELL - MORNING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Villagers cluster around a deep stone well whose water level has sunk dangerously low. Their metal pots scrape the sides, drawing up only a trickle. Faces are drawn and anxious; whispers ripple through the crowd as they peer into the nearly dry shaft.

NARRATOR (V.O.)
"But Devpur has a problem. It faces severe water scarcity"

FIRST LADY, draped in a faded sari, turns to SECOND LADY with worry etched across her brow.

FIRST LADY
"Did you hear, the water level in the well is dropping again"

SECOND LADY
"Last year was bad enough, but this year seems even worse."

FIRST LADY
"I know. I had to walk an extra mile this morning to the river. And the water there isn't clean either. My children are already complaining of stomach aches."


SCENE 3. EXT. VILLAGE COMMON - MIDDAY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The camera pans to a patch of open ground where barefoot youths grapple in a friendly mud-wrestling match. Laughter and cheers offer a brief respite from the village’s worries. A few elders watch from the shade, their smiles tinged with concern as they glance toward the dry fields beyond.


SCENE 4. EXT. FARM FIELDS - AFTERNOON
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A news van bearing the logo "TV News" is parked at the edge of cracked farmland. A TV news reporter holds a microphone while a cameraman frames the shot. VIKRAM, a weathered farmer, stands amid withering crops, wiping sweat from his brow as the sun bears down.

REPORTER
"Vikram ji, can you tell us how the water scarcity is affecting your crops?"

VIKRAM
"Affecting? It's destroying them! I've lost half my yield already. How are we supposed to feed our families? The government promised irrigation projects, but nothing has happened."


SCENE 5. EXT. VILLAGE LANE - EVENING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The sky glows amber as the camera returns to FIRST LADY and SECOND LADY standing outside a courtyard house. They speak in hushed tones while children chase each other nearby, their laughter fading under the weight of adult worries.

FIRST LADY
"These politicians, they only remember us during elections. Once they're in power, they forget all their promises. The MLA from Suryanagar, Mr. Sharma, he hasn't even visited our village since he won last time. He probably doesn't even know we exist."

The women fall silent, gazing toward the well in the fading light as the distant echo of temple bells underscores the village’s uncertainty.
